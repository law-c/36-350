cat("Dear Aliens,\n
    I am sending this message on behalf of the human race. 
    First and foremost, we are humans; we require oxygen
    and water to survive. We breathe oxygen, however, we
    can only drink water. Our total population is about 
    7 billion human individuals.We would like to know why you
    are here? Why did you travel this far? How large is
    your race? What galaxy / solar system are you from?
    Are you willing to share some of your technology? 
    Have you mastered Faster Than Light travel? What basic
    needs do you require to survive?
    
    Thank you for hearing me out and we look forward to an 
    amicable relationship.")
